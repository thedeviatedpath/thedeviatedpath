Hello, I'm Andrew also known as Deviatedpath. I'm an amateur software developer and lover of all things technology.

I have exposure with many languages, but I'm most fluent in Python and Adobe ColdFusion (by force). 

I'm hoping to branch out more to learning the following langauges in the next few years:
  1) Swift
  2) Java
  3) Rust
  
 I'm currently finding projects that need some help with code maintenance. I would love to use this experience to help others get into software development.
 
 I'm working on the idea of streaming software development to encourage more participation.
