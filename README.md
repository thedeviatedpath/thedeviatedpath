Hello, I'm Andrew also known as Deviatedpath. I'm an amateur software developer and lover of all things technology.

I have experiences in a lot of languages, but I mostly reside in Java and Python.

I'm hoping to branch out more to learning the following langauges in the next few years:
  1) Ruby on Rails
  2) C/C++
  3) Swift
  4) C#
  
 I'm currently finding projects that need some help with code maintenance. I would love to use this experience to help others get into software development.
 
 I'm working on the idea of streaming software development to encourage more participation.
